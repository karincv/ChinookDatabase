# ChinookDatabase

I wrote a blog post on the connection between the relational model in data science and noncommutative lattices in algebra:

The open source Chinook database represents a digital media store with the media related data collected from the iTunes Library. 
It is available at: https://github.com/lerocha/chinook-database
I used a jupyter notebook to upload the Chinook database and perform some simple SQL operations.
